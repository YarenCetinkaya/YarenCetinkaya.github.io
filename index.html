          <p align=center>I was born on 24 September 2000 in Silifke district of Mersin
            Province, mediterrean Turkey. I am the only <br>child of my family. My parents are
            both teachers. <br><br> At fifth grade, I went to America and lived there for one
            year. I learned to speak English while I went <br>to their school there. In middle
            my family moved to Konya Province. Then, I went to Meram Science High <br>School for
            4 years. <br><br> All these years, even if I never get educated in art, I self-taught
            myself in traditional art then in <br>University I began to do digital art then sell my
            arts as a freelancer in <a href="https://www.bionluk.com">https://www.bionluk.com</a>.<br>
            Because I always like to explore computers, I choose Computer Engineering as a career
            choice.<br><br> Unlike my thoughts were like this, I went to Electrical Electronics
            Engineering for one year<br> in AYBU(Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University). Then I transfered
            to Computer Engineering again, in AYBU. <br>After I focused on Computer Engineering, I decided
            to specialize in Game Industry like I said before. <br>I began to take courses on Game
            engines and also I took my digital art to an advanced level. I began<br> to join Game Jams.
            Game Jams are some events that you have a theme and 48 to 72 hours to make a game <br>in this
            limited time. So far, I participated in two different Game Jam teams and also we produced two<br>
            different games. <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> is the social site
            for uploading small games like Game Jam games.
